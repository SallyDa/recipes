\section{Chocolate Cardamom Shortbread}

\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{tabular}{ l }
  100g sugar  (plus a bit extra to make it sparkle) \\
  200g butter, soft but not melted \\
  300g flour \\
  30g cocoa powder \\
  3/4 cardamom pods \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Split open the cardamom pods and grind the seeds. Alternatively you could buy powdered cardamom, but I guess it does not have such a strong flavour.
  \item Mix together the butter and 100 g sugar until smooth (you can use a food processor, but I normally do everything by hand, this part with a wooden spoon).
  \item Add the flour, cocoa and ground cardamom to the butter and sugar mixture and combine. I use my hands for this, but you can also continue using the food processor if you have one. At first it seems too dry, but it will come together! When it forms small lumps it is good enough. Scatter the lumps in the tin and press them down lightly.
  \item Put the tin in the fridge (covered with a damp cloth or cling film) for at least half an hour.
  \item Take out of the fridge and use a fork to put small holes into it. Sprinkle with the extra sugar.
  \item Bake for 25-30 minutes at 180 degrees.
  \item Cut in the tin while it is still a bit warm. Wait until cool to remove from tin.
\end{enumerate}
