# Recipes
A collection of cooking recipes...

## Template
The _main.tex_ file controls settings and links to the recipes that are kept in separate tex-files.

For each recipe, a new tex-file has to be created in the folder [part] (e.g. Desserts)

Pictures are kept in the folder [Pictures]/[part]

## Structure
The structure can be changed if the current is not feasible for organising recipes.

__Parts__ are overarching topics like startes, main courses, or desserts.
Each part is subdivided into __chapters__ that contain recipes as __sections__.

more contributors are welcome!
